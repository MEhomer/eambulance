# eAmbulace Comments and Diagnoses Service

### Description
A web API service as a part of a SOA application.

This REST service is used for creating diagnoses by the doctors for the patients for a given time span, 
creating anamnesis (comments) by the patients for their condition for a given time span and listing the 
diagnoses and anamnesis (comments) based on query parameters.
The service is a web application written in the programming language Python and using the Django Web 
Framework. Additionally, I am using the Django Rest Framework for easier definition of the REST APIs for 
the service.
